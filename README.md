# This is a demo of running face recognition on live video from your webcam. It's a little more complicated than the
# other example, but it includes some basic performance tweaks to make things run a lot faster:
#   1. Process each video frame at 1/4 resolution (though still display it at full resolution)
#   2. Only detect faces in every other frame of video.

# PLEASE NOTE: This example requires OpenCV (the `cv2` library) to be installed only to read from your webcam.

# Get a reference to webcam #0 (the default one)

## Use the python file of this project.
### Add Image and the name of the person for face detection.
### To execute the program enter the following Command in terminal/command prompt
> python Face_recognition.py
